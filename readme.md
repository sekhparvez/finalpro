# Gaming Guide Project

## Welcome to the Gaming Guide 

### Steps to create this project

1. Creating the project folder using the command line or using the UI 
2. Installing the dependencies such as `npm install @11ty/eleventy -D`
3. after installing the dependencies make sure to create the start script in package.json file.
4. once everything is set up, you can create eleventy.js file and include the files that will be coved for and also need to return your input and output folders.
5. Once that is complete you will need to create the src folder. create a _includes and start your layout.html.
6. after that you can pretty much configure your project the way you want in terms of how you want to display. 
   

For this project I used Eleventy and YAML, I have not used much markdown as I felt more comfortable just using HTML.


### Complications during the project
 1. One of the major complications for me was getting the  configuration for the project. 
 2. I had faced alot of the issues regarding getting eleventy to send the file over to the output folder. 
 3. But once I figured that out, I was able to start building the project. There's no JS as I am not that great using JS yet but with JS this project site will be even more smooth.


### Future goals of this project
1. to expand the style of the site
2. include a bit of animation
3. include js to make the site more interactive
4. include live data to be stored and retrieved.
